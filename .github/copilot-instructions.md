# BST Debug Visualizer Pro - Custom Instructions

This VS Code extension provides clean, JGrasp-style visualization for Binary Search Trees during C++ debugging.

## Project Goals
- Clean hierarchical tree layout (no physics simulation)
- Minimal node creation (only actual BST nodes)
- JGrasp-style formatting with proper parent-child relationships
- Integration with VS Code debugger for C++ BST structures
- Clear value display with left/right child positioning

## Development Focus
- TypeScript-based VS Code extension
- Custom tree rendering using SVG/Canvas
- Integration with VS Code debug protocol
- Clean, academic-style tree visualization
- Proper BST structure recognition

## Extension Features
- Parse BST data from debug variables
- Render clean tree layout with proper spacing
- Show node values clearly positioned
- Display parent-child relationships
- Support for different BST implementations (pointer-based, array-based)
